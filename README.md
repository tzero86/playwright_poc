# PlayItRight POC

Exploring Playwright with python these days, so I thought I'll create a repo 
to help anyone interested to get started with Playwright Python Automated Testing a bit quicker.

This is just a bare-bones template with some minimal examples and functionalities, you can quickly get started and build on top of it to make it meet your needs.

At the moment it includes the following:

**Current Features:**

- Pytest Support
- Pytest INI Settings for easy CLI arguments management
- Python 3.10 and pytest-playwright usage (synchronous mode for now)
- Page Object Model template

**Planned Additions**:
  - Exporting results in HTML (simple HTML and Allure Reports)
  - Add ability to turn Test Execution Recording ON/OFF
  - Add example usage of Playwright Fixtures & Pytest annotations
  - Explore easy triggers for multi-browser execution



I hope this might help someone.
